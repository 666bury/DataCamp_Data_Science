-- '''Throughout this course, you'll be working with the countries database containing information about the most populous world cities as well as country-level economic data, population data, and geographic data. This countries database also contains information on languages spoken in each country.

-- You can see the different tables in this database by clicking on the tabs on the bottom right below query.sql. Click through them to get a sense for the types of data that each table contains before you continue with the course! Take note of the fields that appear to be shared across the tables.

-- Recall from the video the basic syntax for an INNER JOIN, here including all columns in both tables:


-- SELECT *
-- FROM left_table
-- INNER JOIN right_table
-- ON left_table.id = right_table.id;

-- You'll start off with a SELECT statement and then build up to an inner join with the cities and countries tables. Let's get to it!'''

SELECT * 
FROM cities;

SELECT * 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, region
FROM cities 
INNER JOIN countries 
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
